# 👋 Amandeep Singh (UnknownHuman2)

Welcome to my GitHub. I build games, OSes, and other things nobody asked for.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🐍 Write **Python** like it’s English. Broken, unstructured English.
- 🦀 Learning **Rust** because I enjoy pain and `unsafe` keywords.
- 💥 C++ veteran by trauma, not by choice.
- 🎮 Making a **3D game engine** because using Unity is too mainstream.
- 🧵 Building a **Rust-based OS** for fun (google: ongoing mental health crises).
- 🐧 I use Arch Linux - not for performance, just for the bragging rights.
- 🤖 Using AI to code - not because it’s smart, but because I’m lazy.

## 🧰 Tools I Use

**Languages:**
- Python (friendly)
- C++ (not friendly)
- Rust (pretends to be friendly)

**Things I fight with:**
- Arch Linux - because “working out of the box” is for cowards 
- Git - I use `git push --force` like a pro 
- VS Code - the one true Chrome tab 
- Vim - for when I cosplay as a real hacker. 
- AI (eg. ChatGPT, Gemini) to help me code faster. Which means I now debug both my mistakes and the AI’s.

## 🎯 Current Goals

- Build a 3D game engine from scratch and not abandon it midway.
- Understand Vulkan before it understands me.
- Finish a side project without rewriting it from scratch.
- Make Rust code that doesn’t segfault on line 1.
- Use Arch for a full month without boot issues. (Current streak: 0)
- Use AI tools *without* turning into a “Here’s how I made $10K” influencer.

---

## 🧪 Things I’m Actively trying 

- A custom 3D game engine that almost renders a triangle.
- Low-level OS experiments in Rust & C++ 
- Arguing with ChatGPT over code it hallucinated
- Debugging bugs that shouldn’t exist in files that don’t exist

---

## 🎉 Fun Facts

- My distro breaks more than my spirit - yet I stay loyal (unlike your ex).
- I use AI like a senior dev: blindly trust it and blame it when things break.
- I know enough about computers to fix them.

## 🙅‍♂️ Definitely Not

- ❌ A “10x dev” - I’m more like a 0.1x dev with Wi-Fi issues.
- ❌ A productivity guru - I once debugged the wrong file for 3 hours.
- ❌ A hype-driven developer - if it trends, I ignore it for 2 years first.
- ❌ An indie game savior - I made one enemy AI and called it a day.
- ❌ A web3/NFT believer - my wallet and morals are still intact.
- ❌ A Rust-loving furry with a GitHub - I’ve made bad choices, just not that bad.
